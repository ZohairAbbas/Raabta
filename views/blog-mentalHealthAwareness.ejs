          <p class="lead mb-4">Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year.</p>
  
          <p>Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year. People struggling with 
            their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.

            However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Untreated, 
            mental illness can contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities 
            and increased risk of suicide. 
          
            A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes disturbances in thinking, behavior, energy or emotion that make it 
            difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life. Research is starting to uncover the complicated causes of these diseases which 
            can include genetics, brain chemistry, brain structure, experiencing trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.

            The two most common mental health conditions are:</p>
  
          <blockquote class="quote">
            Anxiety Disorders – More than 18% of adults each year struggle with some type of anxiety disorder, including post-traumatic stress 
            disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (panic attacks), generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobias.

            Mood Disorders – Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar depression, affect nearly 10% of adults each year and are characterized 
            by difficulties in regulating one’s mood
          </blockquote>
  
          
          <!-- <p class="lead mb-4 font-weight-normal text-black">The WHO stress that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” 
            Peak mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness.</p> -->
  
          <p>Although the general perception of mental illness has improved over the past decades, studies show that stigma against mental illness 
            is still powerful, largely due to media stereotypes and lack of education, and that people tend to attach negative stigmas to mental 
            health conditions at a far higher rate than to other diseases and disabilities, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease.

            Stigma affects not only the number seeking treatment, but also the number of resources available for proper treatment. Stigma and 
            misinformation can feel like overwhelming obstacles for someone who is struggling with a mental health condition
